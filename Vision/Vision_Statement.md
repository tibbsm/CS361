Draft Vision Statement


# Abstract
OpenCourse is a platform which creates an environment for students to develop open source projects with their fellow students. OpenCourse offers students access contribute to projects started by past students of courses, collaborate with current students on new projects based on what they are learning in a class, and the ability to pass on their projects to future students who can then add further improvements to the open source project.

# Introduction
In the tech world many employers put a strong emphasis on candidates who have experience contributing to open source projects. Having open source projects to show potential employers is a great way to get your foot in the door. However, as a student you often don't know where to start or how to contributing to projects. In fact, contributing to someone else's project involves integrating into existing social structures, which is difficult and often underdocumented. Some projects make the effort, but they are rare. Even so, large projects are full of complex politics that are borderline incomprehensible from the outside, and navigateing these politics takes a lot of time that could otherwise be used for meaningful contributions to smaller projects. OpenCourse plans to fill this need for students by giving students a place to interact, share ideas and build softwareprojects together. In doing so, OpenCourse will build a strong community of students dedicated to project-based learning principles. This project will connect students together and allow them to learn from and in turn teach other students. These interactions with other students and contributions to projects will help them solidify the information that they are learning in their courses and also give them something to show employers during interviews.

# Description of Problem

## Not enough time in one term course for larger projects - especially with other time commitments
Often there is not enough time during a course to polish and fine tune a project. In addition there may be requirements for a class project, which help illustrate that a student has understood how to implement some feature, which may not be needed in a real-world situation. Additionally, on top of the coursework students often have obligations to many other things in their lives, which hampers them from taking on larger projects in such a short time. However, in order to solidify and show the knowledge of the information that they learn in their courses they often need projects which they can list on their portfolios. While there is the occasional hackathon or class project that students can list on their resumes, there is not enough time to complete a project in such a short amount of time, even with the help of some other team members.

# Description of Solution

My proposed solution is a online service that will connect students who are taking courses with one another and allow them to work on projects together. Using this platform students can contribute to open source projects with their classmates and make lasting relationships with other developers. This collaboration will help solidify what they are learning in their classes, create new relationships with their peers, and allow past students to help new students, and give current students the incentive to put the knowledge they are learning to immediate use and can pass down to future generations of students.

# Description of Metrics for Success
Here are some metrics that can be used to measure the success of this project:

\subsection{Metrics for success}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total number of contributions to project by all users
    \item Average number of contributions to projects per user
    \item Number of unique contributions from different students per project
    \item Amount of discussion going on in chat rooms and forums
    \item Average participation in discussions per user
\end{itemize}
 
# Conclusion 
Students are in the perfect situation to collaborate and learn from one another during their time at school. There is currently a huge waste of resources as hundreds of students go through the same course material term after term and many of them end up with similar clunky projects, if any at all, to show for it. This platform looks to connect students and empower them to use the knowledge they are learning in class to real-world problems that they face each day.

### NOTES

- Students are have around the same level of knowledge. A good open source project is one that matches your existing skills and the skills that you want to build.
- Students also tend to be using the same resources that could be updated or improved. Students complain about the same thing, why not get together and fix it?
- As with Facebook, where "[m]embership was initially restricted to students of Harvard University", ...

> The easiest way to get into open source is to start your own projects.

> Alternatively, you can find a project with a single maintainer and few or no third party patches & fix a serious issue (or add a useful feature). If your patch is accepted, then you've made a social connection with another developer (and maybe even a friend); if your patch isn't accepted, you can maintain your own fork & somebody might contribute to yours.

> Contributing to someone else's project (particularly, large and complex projects) involves integrating into existing social structures, which often is difficult and underdocumented (particularly when the primary goal of the project is to just get the development work done -- such projects often don't go out of their way to make it easy for newbies to contribute, since newbie contributions are liable to be of lower quality). Some projects make a real effort, but that's unusual. Even then, large projects (because they have communities) are full of complex politics that are borderline incomprehensible from outside, and navigating these politics takes a lot of time that could otherwise be used for meaningful contributions to smaller projects.

> This may be an unpopular opinion, but I've never understood why so many people recommend contributing to open-source projects if you are a CS student or beginner. It's a fantastic way to feel inadequate in your ability to write code. If you pick a large open-source project your skills may not be up to scratch to help out in any meaningful way. Even with smaller tasks, a lot of larger projects have enough structure in place to ensure that trusted developers are working on key parts of the project, so it's likely that getting involved will take a lot of effort.
There's definitely an argument for contributing to open source projects, but I'd recommend finding small utilities over big-name projects. These have their own dangers with contributors often abandoning projects, or ignoring issues/pr's, but it's a much easier way to get involved and get some open-source contribution cred on your CV/resume.

> As others have said, the best approach would be to create your own project, and should things go well there maybe look into seeing if there are any now-defunct projects you like the look of that would consider handing the reins over to you to maintain.
>
> One last option would be Google's Summer of Code. It's too late to join in for this year, but it may be worth it next year if you're serious about contributing to a big-name project. The acceptance rate isn't great (I applied three times and didn't get in once, but this was years ago), but given your niche interests you might be a perfect candidate for a handful of projects.
