# Lecture 3.1 - Requirements Overview

### Requirements
* Requirements state the purpose of the system
  * Requirement: Expression of desired behavior
* Very helpful for
  * Communicating with customers and co-workers
  * Keeping track of everything that needs to get done
  * Helping you and the customer decide what really needs to get done, anyway
  * Customers often don't know what they really need.

### Requirement Analysis
* Ways to figure out what the system should do:
  * Get the customer to write down what they want
  * Talk with customers and make some diagrams
  * Watch users in "daily life" to see what they need
  * Look up requirements from a standards body
  * Gather with customer & users to disucss, argue, and negotiate

### Good requirements are...
* Correct - they have to say the right things
* Consistent - they can't contradict each other
* Unambiguos - Each must have 1 interpretation
* Complete - They cover all the important stuff
* Relevant - Each must meet a customer need
* Testable - There must be a way to tell if they are satisfied
* Traceable - There must be a way to determine their origin

### Typical parts of requirements documentation
* Functional requirements
  * Unstructured text
  * Use cases
* Non-functional (quality) requirements
  * Unstructured text
* Diagrams
  * Class diagrams and entity-relationships
  * Dataflow, sequence and state diagrams

### Funcational Requirements
* Can be written as unstructured text
  * Can be written from external or system viewpoint
* Can be written as structured use cases

### External vs System Viewpoint
* External - A requirements definition is stated from the viewpoint of somebady outside the system:
  * System is a blackbox with some interface
  * Emphasis on role of the system
  * e.g. The sprinkler never runs on rainy days

* System - A requirements definition is stated from the viewpoint of somebody inside the system:
  * The environment is accessed via inputs & outputs
  * The emphasis is on how the system works
  * e.g. The controller will not engage the water pump any time the ambient water sensor is triggered

### What's in a (basic) use case?
  * Use case name: succint and meaningful
  * Actor: who "does" the activity?
  * Preconditions: what is true before the activity?
  * Postconditions: What is true after
  * Flow of events: What steps do the actor and the system perform during the scenario?

### Overview of Diagrams
* Use case diagram - show supported activities
* UML class & entity-relationship diagrams - show entities, attributes, relationships
* Dataflow - shows flow of information
* Message Sequance Diagram - show flow of control
* State Chart - shows change over time
