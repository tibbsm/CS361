# A few general comments
* These are just the *basic* diagrams.
  * Sufficient for our homework, exams, and probably 90% of what you'll see after graduation
  * Fancier versions of these diagrams do exist

* It's OK to draw diagrams by hand
  * As long as you respect the notation
  * And, at least for homework, scan it into a PDF
