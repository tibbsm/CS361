# 4.2 - Architecture Decomposition

## Decomposition: providing a detailed view of a component
* Decomposition of the "website" component
* Typical J2EE system: servlet passes data to JSP, which displays it; browser posts back to servlet

## Approaches for decomposing an architecture
* Functional decomposition
* Data-oriented decomposition
* Object-oriented decomposition
* Process-oriented decomposition
* Feature-oriented decomposition
* Event-oriented decomposition

## Functional decomposition
* Breaks each requirement into functions, then breaks functions recursively into sub-functions
  * One component per function or sub-function
* Each **function computationally combines** the output of sub-functions
    * e.g. ticket\_price = fee(station_1) + fee(station_2)
