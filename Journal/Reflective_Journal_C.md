# Reflective Journal C

## Tuesday, February 19, 2019
I figure I would do better on this last journal for this class because I wasn't able to commit as much time to the last journal as I wanted. I suppose there wasn't much that I could've done since I had so many things come up for a new internship that I'll be starting tomorrow. I'll have less time now for school, but I still have my weekends and after work to do my school work. I am lucky to have found a internship that is only a 10 minute walk from my apartment, which saves me a lot of time commuting. My last internship required around a 1 hour commute, so I'm getting almost 2 hours back in my life. I also get to avoid the busy trains in the morning, which I'm sure will do wonders for my mood. 

I'm a little bit behind on working on my expanded vision statement, so I'll be working on that and journaling about it in the next couple of entries. It's great that we don't have any homework due this week, so I can focus on my vision statement. I'm not much of a writer, so I'll definitely have to be consistent in adding to it on a daily page basis so that I can reach the word count requirement. I'm currently sitting at 1,364 word count thankfully and the requirement is at 2,000, so I only need to add around 100 words a day. Definitely doable.

First day of my new internship today. I'm realizing now that I have a lot less time to get these assignments done. I took this for granted over the past month, but I've gotten pretty good grades thus far and am not behind on any of the lessons so far, so I feel good at this point. I plan on watching the next lecture after I get home from work tonight. Hopefully I won't be too tired to watch it when I get back.

I didn't end up having time or energy to watch one of the lectures, so instead I added to my vision statement. The expanded vision statement is the next thing due in class, so this is probably a better allocation of my focus anyways.

* **7.1  With all these issues would it be better to try to adapt document-heavy methods rather than continue to fiddle with agile methods?**

* 7.2  **What are characteristics of a development project (i.e. size, complexity) that would justify using agile methods?  (yes, it's a repeat but it is a critical question)**

* 7.3.  **As with any process where the product is not something you do (think of a science lab), with agile methods no one wants to collect the documentation nor clean it up.  If we persist on using agile methods what can be done it about it?  By individuals?  By organizations?**
