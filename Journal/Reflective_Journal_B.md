# Reflective Journal B

## Thursday, January 31, 2019
I've been meaning to start this journal for the past couple of days, but I've been bogged down with other things. For one I've been busy with the other class I'm taking this winter, CS344. Our new assignment has just been released for that class, so I've been spending my time mostly working on that. On top of that, there are interviews and coding tests for internships are starting to come in for this spring and summer. As important as school is to me, I prioritize work or the opportunity for work/experience over school. I believe I will still have enough time to finish everything and still get good grades, but at this point it feels as if everything is coming at me all at once. So, I haven't been able to commit too much time to this class as of late, but after a few more days of grinding I should be back on the radar for the class.

Alright, so I've really been lagging behind on writing in this journal this time around. I, of course, have my reasons, but considering that I will have to turn this journal in in a couple of weeks, I really need to get back on track. I mentioned a little bit in my last journal entry that I have been busy with career related activities as of late and I think I might of underestimated the time that I would need to allocate to those activities. I received a quite extensive coding assignment from a potential employer and I ended up spending the past week mainly working on that assignment. After that was completed and turned in I had to turn my attention to my class assignments that I need to turn in next. Luckily, I have so far been able to catch up and stay on top of things. I have a few more assignments that I need to finish up for this week, but after that I think I'll be back on track. Expect me to write another journal entry tomorrow! No more slacking off on this class.

* **5.3  We will be moving on to agile methods, where documentation is de-emphasized.  What are circumstances where this might be acceptable?**
