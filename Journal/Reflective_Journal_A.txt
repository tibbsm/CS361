# Reflective Journal A

### Monday, January 7, 2019
I just opened Canvas for the first time this year and checked out the info that has been released for the 2 courses that I'll be taking this term: CS344 OS & CS361 Software Development. I am excited to get back into the swing of things and take both these courses this term as I took the last term off so that I could focus on my work at my internship. I am now at my second internship and while I have been learning a lot on the job, there are many times when I do not know what is being talked about because I haven't taken certain classes. Specifically, there's usually talk about architectures that I have heard of, but know nothing about. It will be nice to finally fill in those gaps in my knowledge and get on the same page with people at my work. I suppose I am a little worried about taking 2 classes and taking the internship, but I am sure that I'll be able to handle the work.
