I just opened Canvas for the first time this year and checked out the info that has been released for the 2 courses that I'll be taking this term: CS344 OS & CS361 Software Development. I am excited to get back into the swing of things and take both these courses this term as I took the last term off so that I could focus on my work at my internship. I am now at my second internship and while I have been learning a lot on the job, there are many times when I do not know what is being talked about because I haven't taken certain classes. Specifically, there's usually talk about architectures that I have heard of, but know nothing about. It will be nice to finally fill in those gaps in my knowledge and get on the same page with people at my work. I suppose I am a little worried about taking 2 classes and taking the internship, but I am sure that I'll be able to handle the work.

Video L0-Overview:

I just watched the first lecture for this class: L0-Overview. It went over the basics for the course. It started out by explaining that software engineering is not just about the design process. In fact, the software development cycle has many steps including, developing requirements, designing solutions, implementation of the project, and testing. 

The question, why are projects over budget so often? And, how do you properly estimate the needs of a project before commiting to it and starting on it. For the first question, I think that under estimation of a project's budget happens for many different reasons. For example, any project has to pass under the scrutiny of the hierarchy of a business and many project leads may underestimate the projec's budget in order to get past the politics inherit in any company. Another reason a project's budget may be underestimated are the unknown issues that crop up in any venture in life. Many projects have known unknowns, which are risk that you are aware of and can be mitigated by planning. However, there are also unknown unknowns which are risks that come from situations that are unexpects and as a result cannot be planned for, atleast directly. 

Software engineering has to deal with these types of problems of estimation and planning. We are given a definition of software engineering as "the application of a systematic, disciplined, **quantifiable**, approach to the development, operation, and maitenance of software." The word quantifable is key here. In order to continually develop better software, we need to be able to measure the software's strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunuties. Quantifiable elements of a software project include the technology's complexity, organizational skills available, available funding and workforce, the project schedule, the stakeholder's interest and assistance, laws and regulations, etc.

Video L1-Overview

I just watched the second lecture video for this week, L1-Overview. This lecture starts out with emphasizing that software is not just about computers. We use computers as tools to solve problems. For example, a microloan website to help people start businesses. 

Another example of a problem is natural disasters. Software can help in this case by locating victims, aid in the distribution of resources, and helping emergency supporters help victims. 

Some other problems software is able to alleviate are pollution, repression, disesase/medicine, etc.

Software engineering is basically problem solving, without making the world worse and without incurring excessive costs. Software engineering solves these problems by creating software.

Thinking about software is not enough. You also need to think about the people that will be using the software and the context that it will be used in. 

A system boundary is the software being developed. People intereact with the system boundary. Is defined by the engineer/designer. 

What is the difference between good software and great software?
- Reliability, efficiency, integrity, usability, maintainability, testability, flexibility, portability, reusability, interoperability.

Great software contains the right features for the right data. You cannot build a great system until you understand what it should do.
- Use cases (the activities a system supports), entities (the kinds of objects that are involved in use cases), attributes (properties of the entities).

Software engineering is a team effort and requires a lot of different skillsets. You will need analysts, designers, programmers, testers, and trainers. 

Course objectives: process, requirements, documents, notations, design, validate, cost & schedule and team.

### L2-Software engineering process

Quality Attributes of great software:
Reliability: Consistency, Accuracy, Error to tolerate,
Efficeincy: Execution efficiency, storage efficiency
Integrity: Access control, Access audit
Usability: Operability, training, and communicativeness...

A process is a well-defined and usually involves a set of tools and techinques
* Uses resources, is subject to constraints and produces intermediate and final products
* may be composed of sub-processes
* has entry and exit  criteria

Life-cycle: the process of building and maintaing the product. 

Typical software task:
* figuring out what the system should do - requirements
* figuring out how the system should do it - design
* writing the code - implementation
* using the using - operation

Types of processes:
Waterfall -
Spiral - 
Agile -

Key Questions 1.1
Why are the elementcs of the SDLC so important for large software systems? Look up Microsoft's Secure Development Lifecycle for clues. 

The SDLC is important to any software system, but is even more important for large systems because it sets out a process for the to be designed, implemented and designed in a way that they are continually and iteratively able to be improved upon. By their very nature large systems are complex. Their sheer size often makes them hard to understand after a quick glance. Th SDLC allows developers to create a system in a set convention that allows other developers to later come in to the project and more easily understand the nature of the project knowing that it originally followed SDLC principles.

1.2 SDLC sounds like a lot of writing. Why is that important?

SDLC involves a lot of writing for a variety of different reasons. One reason for it is to allow the designers, developers, and architects a well-defined view of their design and implementation processes.This type of record is important not only to the specific project that a team is working on together, but also helpful for their development system for all project that they will ever work on. With a written record of their thought processes, they can go back to see why they decided to design software in a certain way. Or, perhaps they missed something in their first design. This brings up another reason of why SDLC involves a lot of writing, which is that the writing allows teams to build upon in a iterative way. With a record of their past work, teams are able to patch up any design holes that they missed the first time around. At the same time, teams are able to see what options they have already tried and if they tried a certain design in the past that didn't work, they have a record that will discourage them fro making the same mistakes again. Finally, perhaps the most important reason for the amount of writing in SDLC is that teams need to communicate with each other effectively in order to work together effectively. Good documentation of the SDLC give a team a point of reference which team members can refer to to get insync with one another. Without this point of reference it is easy for team members to get off track with one another and make mistakes.

I just submitted the first draft for my vision statement and am a little unsure about the topic I picked. I chose to create my project around creating a platform for students to talk to one another and contribute to each other's open source projects. I'm not too sure about it though. It doesn't seem like there will be enough to build up a term-long project around. I picked the topic because it seemed interesting. But seeing that the final word count for the final vision statement need to be around 20,000 words, I'm not sure I can write that much. Doing reasearch on the topic didn't show too many articles or information for me to research. So I hope I am able to find more information about it. I'll give it a fresh look tomorrow and see what I can do.



1.3 SDLC sounds more like project management than software development. Agree or disagree? Why?
* Agree. Project management principles are part of software development process. 

1.4 Computers have become ubiquitous in our lives and societies. Many tragedies have occurred because of computer malfunctions. How could software engineering have helped? Or not? HINT: look up the comp.risks archives for 30 years of malfunctions.
